### Task Achievement

**Band Score: 6**

The essay addresses the requirements of the task. The writer summarizes the information by selecting and reporting the main features. However, the comparison could be more detailed. For example, the writer could have included specific percentages to illustrate the changes more clearly. Also, the term "market share" is not entirely appropriate for discussing school attendance, which affects the accuracy of the report.

### Coherence and Cohesion

**Band Score: 6**

The essay is organized and there is a clear overall progression. However, the writer could have used a wider range of cohesive devices and paragraphing more effectively to enhance the clarity. For instance, there could have been clearer introductory and concluding statements. Additionally, the transition between the years could be smoother.

### Lexical Resource

**Band Score: 6**

The candidate uses an adequate range of vocabulary to convey the information, with some usage of less common expressions. However, there are some inaccuracies, such as "market share," which is not the correct term in this context. Additionally, the word "obivious" seems to be a misspelling of "obvious."

### Grammatical Range and Accuracy

**Band Score: 5**

There is a mix of simple and complex sentence forms, and while some sentences are error-free, there are noticeable mistakes throughout the essay. For example, "Voluntary-controlled schools is" should be "Voluntary-controlled schools are," and "droped" should be "dropped." The consistent errors in verb agreement and spelling affect the overall grammatical accuracy.

### Overall

The overall band score would be the average of the four criteria:

(TA 6 + CC 6 + LR 6 + GRA 5) / 4 = 5.75

This would typically be rounded down to the nearest half band, so the final band score for this essay would be **5.5**.

Please note that this evaluation is based on the information provided and may differ from an actual IELTS examiner's score, as additional context and the full range of an applicant's writing may influence the final assessment.

The table provides a detailed overview of the changing landscape of secondary school attendance among four different types of schools over a span of nine years, from 2000 to 2009. The types of schools included in the analysis are Specialist Schools, Grammar Schools, Voluntary-controlled Schools, and Community Schools. A clear trend emerges from the data, indicating significant shifts in the preferences or allocations of pupils across these school types.

In 2000, the majority of pupils (52%) attended Voluntary-controlled Schools, followed by Grammar Schools with a 24% attendance rate. Specialist and Community Schools each accounted for 12% of the pupil population. This distribution suggests a strong preference or larger availability for Voluntary-controlled Schools at the start of the decade.

By 2005, notable changes had occurred. The proportion of pupils in Voluntary-controlled Schools had decreased sharply to 38%, while Community Schools saw a significant increase, rising to 32%. Attendance at Grammar Schools also declined to 19%, and Specialist Schools saw a slight decrease to 11%. These shifts indicate a movement away from traditional Grammar and Voluntary-controlled Schools towards Community Schools.

The trend became even more pronounced by 2009. Community Schools emerged as the predominant choice for pupils, with a dramatic increase to 58% of the total. This was at the expense of all other school types, which all saw reductions in their proportions. Voluntary-controlled Schools experienced the most significant drop, plummeting to 20%. Grammar Schools' attendance halved from its 2005 figure to 12%, and Specialist Schools decreased marginally to 10%.

The data highlights a clear and significant shift in secondary school attendance patterns over the nine-year period, with a strong move away from Grammar and Voluntary-controlled Schools towards Community Schools. The reasons behind this shift could be manifold, including changes in policy, parental preferences, or perceptions of the quality of education provided by different types of schools. The decline in the proportion of pupils attending Specialist and Grammar Schools suggests a diminishing preference or availability of selective or specialized educational environments, while the dramatic rise in attendance at Community Schools indicates a significant increase in their popularity or capacity.
