## 评分

### Task Achievement

**Band Score: 6**

The essay addresses the requirements of the task. The writer summarizes the information by selecting and reporting the main features. However, the comparison could be more detailed. For example, the writer could have included specific percentages to illustrate the changes more clearly. Also, the term "market share" is not entirely appropriate for discussing school attendance, which affects the accuracy of the report.

### Coherence and Cohesion

**Band Score: 6**

The essay is organized and there is a clear overall progression. However, the writer could have used a wider range of cohesive devices and paragraphing more effectively to enhance the clarity. For instance, there could have been clearer introductory and concluding statements. Additionally, the transition between the years could be smoother.

### Lexical Resource

**Band Score: 6**

The candidate uses an adequate range of vocabulary to convey the information, with some usage of less common expressions. However, there are some inaccuracies, such as "market share," which is not the correct term in this context. Additionally, the word "obivious" seems to be a misspelling of "obvious."

### Grammatical Range and Accuracy

**Band Score: 5**

There is a mix of simple and complex sentence forms, and while some sentences are error-free, there are noticeable mistakes throughout the essay. For example, "Voluntary-controlled schools is" should be "Voluntary-controlled schools are," and "droped" should be "dropped." The consistent errors in verb agreement and spelling affect the overall grammatical accuracy.

### Overall

The overall band score would be the average of the four criteria:

(TA 6 + CC 6 + LR 6 + GRA 5) / 4 = 5.75

This would typically be rounded down to the nearest half band, so the final band score for this essay would be **5.5**.
