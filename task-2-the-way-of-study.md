## 题目

Some university students want to learn about other subjects in addition to their main subjects. Others believe it is more important to give all their time and attention to studying for a qualification.

Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

## 原文

When students enter a university, they may face a variety of small or rather vital choices they have to make, every choice they make can possibly have a huge affection on their outcomes. For instance, some students decide to put all of their available resources into a qualification, while others also want to enrich their lives by taking other subjects aside from their main subjects.

As for the former type of students, they have a certain priority of getting a qualification and can utilize their power to maximize the efficiency to achieve their goal. They probably have their life goal-oriented and can live their life to the full. This way of learning can help students to be more concentrated and achieve their goals faster.

The latter type of students could also be productive, they just do their job in a different way. They may be smarter and can achieve a qualification easily, so they could want to learn something more challenging. Learning a variety of courses can also activate different parts of the brain, introduce new ways of thinking, and widen the students' knowledge basis, this can benefit students in their lifelong development.

Well, as for myself, I'm definitely the latter type. In my opinion, however, there's not a single type of choice being superior or inferior to others, both of the two types of choices we discussed today are good choices as long as the student who made the choice spends adequate effort in the correct ways.

## 点评

As an IELTS examiner, assessing a Writing Task 2 response involves evaluating it across four criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Here's how this essay would score in each category, along with an overall band score. Please note that these scores are subjective and may vary slightly between different examiners.

### Task Response

The essay addresses the prompt by discussing both views and providing the writer's own opinion, which is a requirement for this task. However, the development of ideas is somewhat basic, and the argument could benefit from more detailed examples and a deeper exploration of each viewpoint. The conclusion does attempt to synthesize the discussion, but it lacks a strong, persuasive stance.

**Score: 6.0**

### Coherence and Cohesion

The essay is structured into paragraphs, each representing a different viewpoint and the writer's opinion, which aids in making the text logically organized. However, the transitions between ideas could be smoother, and the essay would benefit from a clearer overall progression of ideas. The conclusion ties the essay together, but the argument's coherence could be enhanced with more explicit linking phrases and a clearer distinction between the writer's voice and the discussed viewpoints.

**Score: 6.0**

### Lexical Resource

The vocabulary is generally appropriate, with some attempts at using a range of expressions ("vital choices," "maximize the efficiency," "lifelong development"). However, there are instances of awkward or incorrect word choices ("huge affection" should be "huge effect"; "power" is a bit vague in this context). The writer could improve by employing a wider variety of vocabulary to express nuances more precisely.

**Score: 6.0**

### Grammatical Range and Accuracy

There are several grammatical errors and awkward constructions throughout the essay ("every choice they make can possibly have a huge affection on their outcomes" should be something like "every choice they make can significantly affect their outcomes"). While some sentences are well-constructed, the overall grammatical range is limited, and the accuracy is inconsistent.

**Score: 6.0**

### Overall

Given the scores across the four criteria and considering the overall effectiveness of the essay in responding to the task, the essay would likely receive an overall band score of:

**Overall Band Score: 6.0**

### Feedback for Improvement

- **Develop your ideas more fully** by including specific examples, reasons, and consequences to support each viewpoint.
- **Work on smoother transitions** between sentences and ideas to enhance the coherence of your essay.
- **Expand your vocabulary** and work on precision in word choice to more accurately express your ideas.
- **Review and practice grammatical structures** to improve the range and accuracy of your writing. Pay particular attention to sentence structure and the correct use of phrases and idioms.

Remember, practice is key to improvement in writing, so consider these points as areas for future focus.

## 修改后

When students embark on their university journey, they are often confronted with a myriad of decisions, each with the potential to significantly impact their academic and professional futures. A common dilemma is whether to dedicate all available resources to excelling in their major or to diversify their education by exploring additional subjects.

Proponents of the focused approach argue that by channeling all efforts into their primary field of study, students can deepen their expertise and enhance their qualifications. This intense concentration on a single discipline can lead to a high level of proficiency and may accelerate the journey towards career goals. Such single-minded dedication is often seen as a pathway to mastery and can be particularly beneficial for those with clear professional objectives.

Conversely, students who advocate for a broader academic experience believe that learning should not be confined to one's major. They argue that engaging with a range of disciplines can foster intellectual flexibility and creativity. Exposure to diverse fields of knowledge can stimulate different cognitive processes, introduce novel problem-solving strategies, and expand a student's intellectual horizon. This holistic approach not only enriches the university experience but also lays the groundwork for lifelong learning and adaptability in an ever-changing world.

Personally, I align with the latter perspective. I am of the opinion that while specialization is valuable, the benefits of a well-rounded education cannot be overstated. The ability to draw connections between disparate fields can lead to innovative insights and a more versatile skill set. However, it is important to acknowledge that neither approach is inherently superior. Success is contingent upon the individual's commitment and the strategic application of their efforts, regardless of the breadth or depth of their academic pursuits.

In conclusion, whether students choose to concentrate solely on their major or to explore a variety of subjects, the key to success lies in their dedication and the effective use of their resources. A balanced approach that accommodates both depth and breadth may often provide the most enriching educational experience and the best preparation for the complexities of the modern workforce.
