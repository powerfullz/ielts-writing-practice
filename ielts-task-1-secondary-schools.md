The chart summarizes the most popular secondary school attendance and provides the proportion and the trend of attendance in 2000, 2005 and 2009. 

From what's being provided from the chart, we can see that there are four major categories of secondary schools, which is Specialist Schools, Grammar Schools, Voluntary-controlled Schools and Community Schools. All of them shares a fairly large portion of the Attendance. 

The Specialist Schools happend to take a steady portion all the time, yet the other three appears to constantly switching places. Voluntary-controlled Schools used to be the most popular choice in 2000, but the situation drastically changed, it started with a overwhelmingly 52% of market share, and still kept 38% in 2005, however, it soon shrinked to 20% in 2009, making it the second most popular choice by that time. Contrast to Voluntary controlled schools, the Community Schools' market share climbed continuously in the three years mentioned in the chart, started as one of the least popular choice, it became the most popular choice by 2009. People appeared to lose interest to the Grammar Schools as well, as the grammar school lost half of it's share by 2009 as it used to have in 2000.

## 评分

Rating an IELTS Writing Task 1 essay involves assessing four key criteria: Task Achievement, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Let's evaluate the essay according to these criteria:

### Task Achievement

The essay addresses the task by summarizing the trends in school attendance over the specified years. It identifies the main trends and makes some comparisons between the different types of schools. However, it could have provided more detailed figures to support its analysis, such as the exact percentages for each school type in each year. This would have demonstrated a clearer understanding and reporting of the data provided. 

**Score: 6.0**

### Coherence and Cohesion

The essay is logically organized, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. However, the transitions between ideas could be smoother, and the essay could benefit from a more structured approach to discussing each school type individually or comparing them more directly. The use of paragraphs is appropriate, but the overall flow of information could be improved.

**Score: 6.0**

### Lexical Resource

The vocabulary is generally appropriate, with terms like "market share" and "overwhelmingly" showing some range. However, the essay occasionally uses phrases awkwardly or inaccurately (e.g., "happend to take a steady portion all the time," which would be more accurately expressed as "maintained a steady proportion throughout the period"). More varied and precise vocabulary could enhance the essay.

**Score: 6.0**

### Grammatical Range and Accuracy

The essay demonstrates a reasonable range of grammatical structures, but there are several errors that hinder clarity and accuracy, such as "happend" instead of "happened" and "shrinked" instead of "shrunk." These mistakes detract from the overall quality of the writing.

**Score: 6.0**

### Overall

The essay provides a basic summary of the data, identifying some trends and changes over time. However, it lacks detailed analysis and misses opportunities to use more precise data and comparisons. Additionally, improvements in vocabulary use, sentence structure, and grammatical accuracy could enhance the overall effectiveness of the writing. Based on the criteria, an overall score of **6.0** seems appropriate, reflecting competent use of English to accomplish the task with some noticeable limitations.

The table provides a detailed comparison of the proportions of pupils attending four different types of secondary schools in the years 2000, 2005, and 2009.

Initially, in 2000, the majority of students (52%) attended Voluntary-controlled Schools, making it the most popular type of secondary education. Grammar Schools were the second most popular, with 24% of the pupil population, followed by Community Schools and Specialist Schools, each holding a 12% share. Over the nine-year period, significant changes occurred in the preferences for school types among students.

By 2005, although Voluntary-controlled Schools remained the most popular, their share had decreased to 38%. Remarkably, Community Schools saw the most significant increase, jumping to 32% from their initial 12%, indicating a growing preference for this type of school. Conversely, Grammar Schools experienced a decline to 19%, and Specialist Schools slightly decreased to 11%.

The trend continued into 2009, culminating in a dramatic shift in school popularity. Community Schools surged to become the most favored, claiming 58% of the student population, a stark contrast to their position in 2000. This surge came at the expense of both Voluntary-controlled and Grammar Schools, which plummeted to 20% and 12%, respectively, indicating a significant decrease in their appeal. Specialist Schools maintained a relatively stable, albeit minor, presence throughout the years, ending with a 10% share in 2009.

In summary, the data highlights a dramatic shift in secondary school attendance over the nine-year period, with Community Schools emerging as the predominant choice by 2009. This change reflects a significant realignment in educational preferences among students, with a clear move away from the traditionally favored Voluntary-controlled and Grammar Schools towards Community Schools.
